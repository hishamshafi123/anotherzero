2. Drag and drop the `crm-dashboard/build` folder to Netlify
3. Or connect your Git repository for automatic deployments

### 2. Vercel (Free)
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Navigate to your project: `cd crm-dashboard`
3. Run: `vercel --prod`
4. Follow the prompts to deploy

### 3. GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Install gh-pages: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
2. Add to package.json scripts: `"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"`
